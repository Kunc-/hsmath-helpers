# Factorial

This project was intended to test my C++ knowledge, and ability to include external libraries.

It outputs a list of each factorial's number of zeroes and number of digits. It also outputs the factorial of each power of 10.

## Compilation

The following command (assuming gmp is installed already):
    g++ factorial.cpp -o factorial -lgmp -lgmpxx
